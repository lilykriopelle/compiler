These are some simple files that you may wish to use to test your TAC
generator and x86 code generator.  There is not a strict ordering to
which ones you should try to get to work first, but this is roughly
the order in which I created them, so the first groups should be
fairly short and not complex.

For each test, there is a file.ic file with the source code, and a
file.expected file that contains the expected output.  

Let me know if you have any problems getting these to work, if you
think the expected output is wrong (!), or if you have other test
cases that you think are worth adding to the directory.
